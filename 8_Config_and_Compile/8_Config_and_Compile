Chapter 8:

2. When modules have to be compiled for the host kernel, its sources can be found
at "/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build"
alternatively "/usr/src/linux"

Kernel source browser is useful (when grep and find are not enough):
lxr / opengrok / cscope / GNU Global

3. Kernel Configuration:
A .config file is created in the main source directory.
The options contained can also be stored inside the kernel.
If the CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC option is turned on, info can be read from
	/proc/config.gz or/boot/.../config...

4. Building & Makefiles
	described in Documentation/kbuild/

	Essential components:
	- top-level Makefile
	- .config file
	- top-level architecture Makefile
	- subdirectory makefiles
	- in each dir with a makefiles, there is also a Kconfig
		interfacing with the Kernel cfg utilities
   => 3 main ingredients: source, Makefile, Kconfig

5. initrd and initramfs
	Before loading the root filesystem, some kernel modules or firmware have to be loaded.
	The GRUB configuration file needs a line pointing to the initramfs file.
	The initramfs is made in Debian with mkinitramfs

Configuration utilities:
- make config - pure text based
- make menuconfig - ncurses GUI
- make xconfig - x-based, built on qt
- make gconfig - x-based, buil on gtk
	* excellent tips in "Linux Kernel in a Nutshell" by Greg Kroah-Hartman

Compiling & installing:
- make the copressed kernel (bzImage) and copy it in /boot
- also copy System.map for logging/debugging
- save kernel configuration for future referencing
- make the modules and install them in/lib/modules/kernel-version
- construct new initramfs and copy it in /boot
- update bootloader configuration
